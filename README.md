So, after sitting here untouched for two years (what the heck?) I've hit on a notion for this project.  It's actually a tad simpler than it was but, be that as it may, is no longer quite so pie in the sky.  I've also renamed the project away from 'legitalese' to something just as stupid: AMERICODE.

The idea is to represent contemporary American law in source code... probably a domain specific language that someone else can write a compiler against in input interface for (say, when the law must be applied to a set of circumstances for judgement.)

This is going to take a ridiculous amount of research, a little invention, and probably collaboration from people much smarter than myself... but that's why we're doing this open source!
